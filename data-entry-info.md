# Data entry info

This is some info for the data entry job. It doesn't explain everything, just ask any doubts.
Honestly there is a lot of work to do and I'm doing everything ðŸ˜‚

## Tables

```json
{
  "type": "table",
  "page": 234,
  "colStyles": ["text-center", "text-center", "text-center"],
  "rows": [
    ["General Skill Action", "Proficiency", "Page"],
